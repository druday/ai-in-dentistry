# Data layout

- `raw/`: raw PubMed snapshots (`pubmed_records_<query_id>.jsonl`)
- `interim/`: temporary artifacts generated during processing
- `processed/`: final publication-level table used for network analysis

Raw and derived data files are intentionally gitignored to keep repository size manageable.
